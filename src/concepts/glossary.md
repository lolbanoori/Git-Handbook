# Glossary

- **Git**: A free open source version control system available for installation on Unix-based platforms, Windows and macOS.
- **Version control systems (VCS)**: A tool to safely test code before releasing it, allow multiple people collaborate on the same coding projects together, and stores the history of that code and configuration.
- **Source Control Management (SCM)**: A tool similar to VCS to store source code.
- **Repository**: An organization system of files that contain separate software projects.
- **Git directory**: A database for a Git project that stores the changes and the change history.
- **Commit**: A command to make edits to multiple files and treat that collection of edits as a single change.
- **Commit files**: A stage where the changes made to files are safely stored in a snapshot in the Git directory.
- **Commit ID**: An identifier next to the word commit in the log.
- **Commit message**: A summary and description with contextual information on the parts of the code or configuration of the commit change.
- **Working directory**: The directory on your system where your project files reside and are modified before staging.
- **Modified files**: A stage where changes have been made to a file, but they have not been stored or committed.
- **Git staging area**: A file maintained by Git that contains all the information about what files and changes are going to go into the next commit.
- **Stage files**: A stage where the changes to files are ready to be committed.
- **Tracked**: A file’s changes are recorded.
- **Untracked**: A file’s changes are not recorded.
- **Patch**: A command that can detect that there were changes made to the file and will do its best to apply the changes.
- **Diff**: A command to find the differences between two files.
- **Rollback**: The act of reverting changes made to software to a previous state.
- **Reset**: A Git command used to undo changes by modifying the index and working directory.
- **Stash**: A temporary storage where Git saves uncommitted changes so you can work on something else.
- **Branch**: A pointer to a particular commit, representing an independent line of development in a project.
- **Head**: This points to the top of the branch that is being used.
- **Master**: The default branch that Git creates when a new repository is initialized; commonly used to place the approved pieces of a project.
- **Fast-forward merge**: A merge when all the commits in the checked out branch are also in the branch that's being merged.
- **Three-way merge**: A merge that uses the snapshots at the two branch tips along with their most recent common ancestor (the commit before the divergence).
- **Merge conflict**: This occurs when the changes are made on the same part of the same file, and Git won't know how to merge those changes.
- **Merge**: An operation that combines the origin/master branch into a local master branch.
- **Rebasing**: The act of changing the base commit used for a branch.
- **Interactive rebase**: A Git process for modifying individual commits to keep history clean and organized.
- **.gitignore**: A file that specifies intentionally untracked files Git should ignore.
- **Alias**: A shorthand name for a remote repository URL used in Git commands.
- **Remote repositories**: Repositories that enable developers to work independently on local copies while contributing to a shared project.
- **Remote branches**: Read-only branches that reflect data from a remote repository.
- **Forking**: Creating a copy of a repository under your own user account.
- **GitHub**: A web-based Git repository hosting service that enables sharing, access, and cloning of repositories.
- **Pull request**: A GitHub mechanism for proposing changes that are reviewed before merging into a main branch.
- **Pull request review**: The process of evaluating, commenting on, and approving or rejecting proposed code changes in a pull request.
- **Merge commit**: A commit created when merging branches that retains the full history of both branches.
- **Squash merge**: A Git merge option that combines all commits from a branch into a single commit.
- **Squash commits**: Combining multiple commits into one and optionally editing the resulting commit message.
- **Rebase and merge**: A Git operation that applies each commit from a branch onto the base branch without creating a merge commit.
- **Indirect merge**: A merge that happens when a branch is merged externally into another branch that is already merged.
- **Code review**: A systematic peer examination of code to identify issues, improve quality, and maintain standards.
- **Google style guide**: A coding convention maintained by Google to standardize and improve readability across their codebase.
- **Pair programming**: A technique where two developers work together at one workstation to write and review code.
- **Tool-assisted review**: A form of code review using software tools that allow asynchronous, tracked feedback with analytics.
- **Issue tracker (bug tracker)**: A system that shows pending tasks, their status, and who's responsible for them.
- **Fix up**: The decision to discard commit messages for that commit.
- **Pipelines**: Defined steps in an automated process to reach a desired result (e.g., build, test, deploy).
- **CI/CD**: The name for the entire continuous integration and continuous deployment system.
- **Continuous integration (CI)**: A system that automatically builds and tests code with every change.
- **Continuous deployment (CD)**: New code is deployed often after it has been automatically built and tested.
- **Application Programming Interface (API) key**: An authentication token used to call an API and identify the person, programmer, or program accessing a system.
- **Computer protocols**: Guidelines published as open standards that allow protocols to be implemented across various products.
- **Secure Shell (SSH)**: A secure protocol for connecting to servers remotely.
- **SSH protocol**: A standard based on public-key encryption used for remote server access.
- **SSH key**: A credential used for SSH authentication.
- **SSH client**: Software that initiates a secure connection to an SSH server.
- **SSH server**: A system that accepts incoming SSH connections, authenticates them, and establishes secure sessions.
- **Private key**: A secret cryptographic key used to decrypt data encrypted with the corresponding public key.
- **Public key**: A cryptographic structure used for secure communication and validating digital signatures.
